<h2>Why Synthetic Programming?</h2>
<i>Chris Mueller</i>

<p>
<i>This is a work in progress...</i>

<p>
CorePy was originally developed to provide a convenient method for
developing AlitVec/VMX programms from Python.  As CorePy evolved, a
new programming paradigm, <i>synthetic programming</i>, was developed
to help manage the task of generating hardware instructions at
run time.  

<p>
Synthetic programming is built around three observations.
First, only small portions of most applications require truly
high-performance implementations.  User interfaces and small-scale
data processing tasks execute at acceptable speeds in interpreted
languages.  Occasionally a task will become noticabily slow when
executed by a scripting language, at which point the task may be 
ported to a compiled language.  This requires the developer to switch 
languages and add an additional level of compmlexity to the
toolchain. 

<p>
The next observation is that the common compiled languages, C, C++,
and FORTRAN were designed for machine models that are no longer
realistic.  Attempts to accomodate vector processors and multi-core
systems at the language-level have been largely unsucessful, often
requiring the users to use intrinsics that are merely thin wrappers
around assembly instructions.  These languages simply do not have the
semantic breadth to handle the demands of modern hardware. 

<p>
The final observation is that developers are very productive with 
highly interactive languages.  Langauges that allow developers to
iterate quickly through a range of solutions keep developers engaged
in the development process.  Even short delays imparted by a 20 second
compilation can be enough to lead the developer to a 2 minute Slashdot break.
